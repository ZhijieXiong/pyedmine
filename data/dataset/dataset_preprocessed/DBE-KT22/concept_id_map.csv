4,0,Set,"In mathematics, a set is nothing more than a collection of objects. Similarly, in databases, records within a table can be treated as objects in a set - i.e. the table becomes a set of records. The SET operator allows the tables of a database to be treated as objects in a set when performing a query."

More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data."
48,41,Entity,"An entity is a real-world thing that can be distinctly identified as a person, place, or concept. It is an object which is distinguishable from others."
49,42,Total,"It specifies that each entity present in the entity set must mandatorily participate in at least one relationship instance of that relationship set,for this reason, it is also called as mandatory participation"

79,68,Renaming,"Renaming is used to rename either the relation name or the attribute names, or both."
80,69,Database Security,Database security refers to the collective measures used to protect and secure a database or database management software from illegitimate use and malicious cyber threats and attacks.
81,70,Access Control,"Access control is done by creating user accounts and to control login process by the DBMS. So, that database access of sensitive data is possible only to those people (database users) who are allowed to access such data and to restrict access to unauthorized persons."
82,71,Discretionary access control (DAC),Based on the concept of access privileges for giving users such privileges. SQL support DAC; most commercial DBMSs also support DAC.
83,72,GRANT,GRANT gives privileges to users.
84,73,Mandatory Access Control (MAC),Restrict access to objects based on the sensitivity of the information contained in the objects and the formal authorization of subjects to access information of such sensitivity.
85,74,SQL Injection,SQL injection attacks from internal and external users
86,75,REVOKE,REVOKE takes away privileges from users.
87,76,Specifying Privileges - Views,Views provide an important mechanism for discretionary authorization.

89,78,Authentication,Authentication is the process of confirming that a user logs in only in accordance with the rights to perform the activities he is authorized to perform. User authentication can be performed at the operating system level or database level itself.
90,79,Trojan Horse attacks,"Trojan Horse attacks: If Steve tricks Bob into copying data from table R into table R0, then the access control on table R doesn’t apply to the copy of the data in table R0."
91,80,Transactions,A transaction is a sequence of database operations grouped together for execution as a logic unit in a DBMS.
92,81,ACID Properties,"DBMSs ensure the following properties of transactions. Atomicity is the execution of each transaction is atomic, i.e., either all operations are completed or not done at all. Consistency is the states of a database that are consistent (w.r.t. defined business rules) before and after each transaction. Isolation is execution results of each transaction should be unaffected by other concurrently executing transactions. Durability is once a transaction has been successfully completed, its effects should persist in the database"
93,82,Isolation,"In database systems, isolation determines how transaction integrity is visible to other users and systems."
94,83,Locking,Locking protocols are used in database management systems as a means of concurrency control. Multiple transactions may request a lock on a data item simultaneously.
95,84,Concurrent Transactions,Concurrent transaction or execution includes multiple transactions which are executed concurrently or simultaneously in the system.
96,85,Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol,Two-Phase Locking Protocol is also known as 2PL protocol is a method of concurrency control in DBMS that ensures serializability by applying a lock to the transaction data which blocks other transactions to access the same data simultaneously. Two-Phase Locking protocol helps to eliminate the concurrency problem in DBMS.
97,86,Logging,Logging is a technique for recovery (assuring atomicity and durability of transactions).
98,87,The Dirty Read Problem,"Dirty read is a read of uncommitted data. If a particular row is modified by another running application and not yet committed, we also run an application to read the same row with the same uncommitted data."
99,88,The Unrepeatable Read Problem,The unrepeatable problem occurs when two or more read operations of the same transaction read different values of the same variable.
100,89,The Lost Update Problem,"In the lost update problem, an update done to a data item by a transaction is lost as it is overwritten by the update done by another transaction."
101,90,Read Uncommitted,Read Uncommitted is the least restrictive isolation level.
102,91,Read Committed,"Read Committed is One transaction only sees committed changes by other
transactions."
103,92,Serializable,Serializable is the highest solution level. All transactions are totally isolated from other transactions. It is safe but may cause significant performance hit.
